##### PHYS 562 : Graduate Electromagnetic Theory, McGill University

This graduate course covers electrostatics, magnetostatics, electrodynamics, special relativity, and finishes with Lorentz-invariant electromagnetic theory, requiring working knowledge of general relativity, namely the spacetime metric $$g_{\mu\nu}$$. 
I created solutions for all assignments and contributed to the exams in this course. The complete course content can be found below. I have just started with this course this past semester, but plan to continue in the future.

##### PHYS-257 : Experimental Methods I, McGill University
 This undergraduate course is the first class in a laboratory for undergraduates. It covers introductory techniques in data taking, such as what quality data is, how to improve the accuracy and precision of various experiments, and how to statistically analyse data in an effort to determine areas of improvement. My responsiblity was to teach Python and the numerical techniques required to perform various statistics on experimentally obtained (and therefore noisy) data. Below are some example presentations given in the course. I've assisted teaching this course for the last 3 consecutive years.

##### PHYS-241 : Singal Processing, McGill University

This course serves as the first introduction to undergraduates of electrical signal processing. It reviews basic circuits, such as voltage dividers, and progresses up to an including RLC circuits, complex impedences, RF electronics, and others. I've assisted teaching this course during the Winters of 2019, 2020, and 2021.

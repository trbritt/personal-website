The primary focus for my Master's degree was to design and implement a time-resolved electron
eenrgy loss spectrometer integrated into the existing ultrafast electron diffraction spectrometer at the 
Siwick Lab, McGill University. The design of the electro-optics and their promsied energy resolution 
was simulated via FDTD simulations in C.

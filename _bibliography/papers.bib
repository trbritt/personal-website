  abstract={Transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers
  and heterostructures are highly tunable material systems that provide excellent models
  for physical phenomena at the two-dimensional
  (2D) limit. While most studies to date have
  focused on electrons and electron-hole pairs,
  phonons also play essential roles. Here, we
  apply ultrafast electron diffraction and diffuse
  scattering to directly quantify, with time and
  momentum resolution, electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2
  ) and phonon transport from the
  monolayer to a silicon nitride (Si3N4
  ) substrate.
  Optically generated hot carriers result in a profoundly anisotropic distribution of phonons in
  the monolayer on the ~ 5 ps time scale. A
  quantitative comparison with ab-initio ultrafast dynamics simulations reveals the essential
  role of dielectric screening in weakening EPC.
  Thermal transport from the monolayer to the
  substrate occurs with the phonon system far from equilibrium. While screening in 2D is
  known to strongly affect equilibrium properties, our findings extend this understanding to
  the dynamic regime.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

	title = {High-precision magnetic field measurement and mapping of the {LEReC} 180° bending magnet using very low field {NMR} with Hall combined probe (140-350 G)},
	journal = {Measurement Science and Technology},
	abstract = {The relativistic heavy ion collider (RHIC) at BNL uses low-energy RHIC electron cooling (LEReC) to conduct experiments to search for the quantum chromodynamic critical point. The first ever electron cooling based on the RF acceleration of electron beams was experimentally demonstrated on April 5, 2019 using LEReC at BNL. The first critical step in obtaining successful 3D non-magnetized cooling of the Au ion bunches in the RHIC cooling section was matching the electron beam energy with a relative error less than 5 × 10−4 to the ion beam energy. Part of the LEReC beamline is a dipole magnet that bends the electron beam 180°. One of the most outstanding measurement challenges is that the dipole field is so low (≈200 G). Most of the existing NMR probes can only measure fields >400 G. A lower signal-to-noise ratio at low fields requires the use of larger sample volumes. Working with CAYLAR, the NMR probe has been redesigned and optimized for these low field measurements with high resolution. We report the methods, challenges and results for extensive magnetic field mappings of the 180° dipole magnet. A combination of NMR and Hall sensors was successfully implemented to measure uniform field regimes inside the magnet center area and non-uniform field regimes at the magnet ends. Detailed measurement and mapping were performed at five radii and five heights along the beam trajectory. Meanwhile, a finite element magnetic modeling simulation of the magnet using Opera software was performed. The calculated and measured data were compared, and the calculated data are a good reference for the measured data over long length mapping from the magnet edge to the center. The measured magnetic measurement data are directly useful for beam instrumentation, diagnostics and operation.},

  abstract = { Many theoretical speculations suggest that the well-known inverse square law of gravity might be modified at short distances. We propose to improve the constraints on possible Yukawa modifications of the gravitational inverse square law at very short distances of order 1-100 angstroms using slow neutron optical measurements. In particular, we propose to exploit an interesting neutron optical phenomenon called the null Fizeau effect to conduct a sensitive search using neutron interferometry. Unlike other neutron-based approaches, the proposed technique is first-order insensitive to the neutron-nucleus strong interaction and possesses a small number of well-understood and calculable systematic errors. With an optimized experiment the sensitivity of this method at existing neutron interferometry facilities to possible new Yukawa interactions of the neutron can probe a modification of gravity of the form V (r) = −GMm/r[1 + α exp (−r/λ)] with α = 1018 for λ = 40 angstroms, an improvement in sensitivity by about three orders of magnitude. }
